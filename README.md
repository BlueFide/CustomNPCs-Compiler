# CustomNPCs-Compiler
A powerful CustomNPC scripting framework to create advanced scripts very easy and efficiently.


##### Tired of...
 - Copying same pieces of code across multiple scripts?
 - Manually searching and deobfuscating Minecraft's Obfuscated methods?
 - Having to write in old ES5 JavaScript?
 - Having to use numerical gui ids in CustomNPC's Custom Gui feature?
 
##### Well now you can...
 - import files to keep the same code into one file.
 - write obfuscated Minecraft methods in a normal way.
 - write in ES6+ JavaScript, because this compiler has Babel integrated. This will get transpiled down to valid, runnable ES5 JavaScript.
 - use alphabetical names for gui ids.


## Installation & Setup

### Requirements
In order to use the compiler, you need to have the following requirements:
1. Having NodeJS/NPM installed on your machine (To be able to run `npm` commands)
2. Having PHP installed on your machine, because the compiler is written in the PHP programming language.
3. Be able to run PHP from commmand like (`php` commands). You can check this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka44kcFSruk) on how to do so.
4. **Zero PHP-Programming knowledge, only the compiler is written with it.**

### Installing
Fork this project or download it as ZIP.
The advantage of forking is that you can stay updated when the compiler updates.
